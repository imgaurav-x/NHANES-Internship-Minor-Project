This repository contains my Internship Minor Project completed during my internship at **Corizo Edutech Pvt. Ltd.**. 
The project focuses on exploratory data analysis and visualisation of anthropometric (body measurement) data 
from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2020** dataset.

The primary objective of this project is to analyse and compare body measurements of adult male and female 
participants using Python-based data analysis techniques. The dataset includes variables such as body weight, 
height, arm length, leg length, waist circumference, and hip circumference. These measurements are analysed 
to understand distribution patterns, variability, correlations, and gender-based differences.

The project involves multiple stages, including data acquisition, preprocessing, feature engineering, 
statistical analysis, and visualisation. Key health indicators such as **Body Mass Index (BMI)**, 
**Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR)**, and **Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR)** are computed to assess body composition 
and fat distribution. Standardisation using z-scores is applied to enable fair comparison across variables 
with different units and scales.

Visual analysis techniques such as histograms, box-and-whisker plots, scatterplot matrices, and correlation 
analysis are used to identify trends, outliers, and relationships between body measurements. The project also 
includes an outlier analysis to study individuals with extreme BMI values and interpret their standardised 
body measurements.

This repository contains the complete Jupyter Notebook with explanations, code, and visual outputs, along 
with a PDF report generated from the notebook and the original NHANES datasets used for the analysis. The 
project demonstrates practical application of Python libraries such as **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and 
Seaborn** for real-world data analysis and reporting.
